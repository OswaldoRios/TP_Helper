# TP_Helper
Break Reminder / KMS Alternate

Hello! And welcome to the TP_Helper program:

The purpose of this program is to remind agents at a call center when to take their breaks.
A lot of the time they forget and it affects their adherence to their schedule which is very important to the call center to have on goal.

What the break reminder does is that it shows a pop-up message 2 minutes before the agent's break so
that they can take it on time.

Another function of the program is that it allows the user to search frequently asked questions to help them 
in a situation they have not faced before.

The goal is to help call center agents maximize their efficiency in the work field!
